# NEWS DATA LOG ANALYSIS
This is a simple CLI report to get a feel for what is trending and how the News Data website is being utilized by viewers.

### The News Data Log Analysis uses the logs of viewer activity to answer the following questions:

1. What are the most popular three articles of all time? 
	* Which articles have been accessed the most? 

2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time? 
	* That is, when you sum up all of the articles each author has written, which authors get the most page views?

3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?


### RUNNING A LOG ANALYSIS REPORT:
If you'd like to run a Log Analysis Report in the command line type the following script:
`python newsdata_db.py`
